# LearnLoop
In a world where learning is increasingly community-centric and self-paced, the need for a digital ecosystem that encourages both skill-sharing and personal growth has never been greater. As part of the IT3030 – Programming Applications and Frameworks (PAF) module at SLIIT, our team is undertaking the development of a comprehensive Skill-Sharing & Learning Platform—a modern web application that empowers individuals to learn, teach, engage, and grow together through shared knowledge and experiences.

The solution is built using Java Spring Boot for the backend RESTful API and ReactJS for the frontend interface, with OAuth 2.0-based authentication to ensure secure and seamless login via social media platforms. The platform focuses not just on functionality, but also on creating a user-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing environment that encourages participation and lifelong learning.
